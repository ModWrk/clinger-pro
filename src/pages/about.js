      <p>
      Donald Clinger started this business in May of 1997 with nothing more than a dream and a hard work ethic. It started small and worked into what it is today with little debt or big expenses so we could keep our prices low for our customers and always strive to be better. The motto is the Golden Rule “Treat everyone the way you would want to be treated!” We thank all of our customers for their business and look forward to providing a great service for you too! We’re here today and we’ll be here tomorrow!
